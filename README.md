# snapgame

The Task

Try to develop a game of snap for a minimum of 2 players. Each player is dealt a random but equal portion of the cards (from a 52 card deck) and reveal from the top of their pile in turn until a matching number occurs.  If the numbers match, that player wins the stack of cards played so far.  Play continues until a player runs out of cards.

Notes

    Once you start, you have 90 mins to complete as much of the code as possible.

    After the time runs out, push to your GitHub repo, then send the link through.

    The code format should be modern PHP, OOP based using PSR-2 standards.

    All code must be your own original code and be well documented.


Please note: There is no wrong or right method of approach for this task.  It is a test purely used to determine your coding technique and style.
